== Introduction

Eclipse Krazo is an implementation of action-based MVC specified by Jakarta MVC 2.0.
It builds on top of Jakarta RESTful Webservices (former JAX-RS)  and currently contains support for RESTEasy and Jersey
with a well-defined SPI for other implementations.

This is user guide for Eclipse Krazo {krazo-version}.
We are trying to keep it up to date as we add new features.
