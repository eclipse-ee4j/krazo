== Configuration

This section describes how you can configure your MVC application by overwriting properties inside the JAX-RS Application class.
For example, you can overwrite a exemplary property `foo` inside the Application like this:

[source,java]
....
public class MyApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public Map<String, Object> getProperties() {
        final Map<String, Object> props = new HashSet<>();

        props.put("foo", "bar");

        return props;
    }
}
....

=== CSRF

For the usage of CSRF, the MVC API and Krazo provide different properties to customize its behavior.

==== jakarta.mvc.security.CsrfProtection

By default, the CSRF protection for MVC resources is set to `Csrf.CsrfOptions#EXPLICIT`, which means, that you're required to set the `@CsrfProtected` annotation over a Controller method annotated with `@POST`, `@PUT`, `@PATCH` or `@DELETE`.
In case you want to use CSRF protection in all methods annotated with one of these HTTP verbs, you can set the property `jakarta.mvc.security.CsrfProtection` to `CsrfOptions#IMPLICIT`.

[source,java]
....
public class MyApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public Map<String, Object> getProperties() {
        final Map<String, Object> props = new HashSet<>();

        props.put("jakarta.mvc.security.CsrfProtection", CsrfOptions.IMPLICIT);

        return props;
    }
}
....

Although, you might want to disable CSRF protection completely for you application.
Therefore exists the `CsrfOptions#OFF` value, which can be set like the
`CsrfOptions#IMPLICIT` value in the example above.

==== jakarta.mvc.security.CsrfHeaderName

Sometimes you may want to set a custom value for the header transporting the CSRF token.
For this task you can use the property `jakarta.mvc.security.CsrfHeaderName`.
Overwriting this property will change the default name of the HTTP header from `X-CSRF-TOKEN` to any valid HTTP header name.
The property can be changed like this:

[source,java]
....
public class MyApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public Map<String, Object> getProperties() {
        final Map<String, Object> props = new HashSet<>();

        props.put("jakarta.mvc.security.CsrfHeaderName", "X-CUSTOM-CSRF-HEADER");

        return props;
    }
}
....

==== org.eclipse.krazo.csrfTokenStrategy

To generate CSRF tokens, Krazo provides two mechanisms by default: a cookie-based and a session-based algorithm, where the session-based is set as default.
In case you want to change the strategy or even want to use some custom one, you can change the used strategy with the `org.eclipse.krazo.csrfTokenStrategy` property.
For example, you can switch to the cookie-based token strategy by using this setting:

[source,java]
....
public class MyApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public Map<String, Object> getProperties() {
        final Map<String, Object> props = new HashSet<>();

        props.put("org.eclipse.krazo.csrfTokenStrategy", CookieCsrfTokenStrategy.Builder.build());

        return props;
    }
}
....

The `org.eclipse.krazo.security.CookieCsrfTokenStrategy` can be customized via its `Builder`, but that isn't in the scope of this documentation.
Please have a look into the JavaDoc for this.

=== Views

Eclipse Krazo provides some configuration properties, where someone can customize the behavior of the view handling.
These configurations will be described in the following sections.

==== org.eclipse.krazo.redirectScopeCookies

By default, Krazo uses a URL re-write mechanism to store the information about `@RedirectScope`d beans. In case someone doesn't want this behavior, Krazo
                                                                                also supports a cookie-based strategy for this task. To enable this feature, the property `org.eclipse.krazo.redirectScopeCookies` needs to be overwritten inside the JAX-RS Application class:

[source,java]
....
public class MyApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public Map<String, Object> getProperties() {
        final Map<String, Object> props = new HashSet<>();

        props.put("org.eclipse.krazo.redirectScopeCookies", true);

        return props;
    }
}
....

==== org.eclipse.krazo.defaultViewFileExtension

While developing a completely new MVC application, someone normally just uses one template engine for all of its views.
This means, that every view file ends with the same extension and this leads to less readable code.
To set this extension as a default for all view files, Krazo provides the property
`org.eclipse.krazo.defaultViewFileExtension`, which takes a string containing the name of the file extension:

[source,java]
....
public class MyApplication extends Application {

    @Override
    public Map<String, Object> getProperties() {
        final Map<String, Object> props = new HashSet<>();

        props.put("org.eclipse.krazo.defaultViewFileExtension", "jsp");

        return props;
    }
}
....

In this example, Krazo will assume that every view is a JSP file.
So in case you return the view `edit` from your Controller, Krazo will search for a file `edit.jsp`.
