# Eclipse Krazo 3.0.1

Jakarta MVC is built on top of Jakarta RESTful Webservices. This means that Eclipse Krazo can be run on most application servers without any additional configuration. You will just need to include the Jakarta MVC API JAR as well as the Eclipse Krazo module for the Jakarta RESTful Webservices implementation shipped with your application server.

Eclipse Krazo requires at least the Jakarta EE 10 Web-Profile.

## Required dependencies

You will always need Jakarta MVC and Krazo Core.

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>jakarta.mvc</groupId>
  <artifactId>jakarta.mvc-api</artifactId>
  <version>2.1.0</version>
</dependency>

<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.krazo</groupId>
  <artifactId>krazo-core</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

The dependencies you need to add to your pom.xml file depend on which application server your are using, or more
specifically which Jakarta RESTful Webservices implementation the application server has built in.

### Eclipse Jersey

Examples: Eclipse GlassFish, Payara Server.

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.krazo</groupId>
  <artifactId>krazo-jersey</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### RESTEasy

Examples: OpenLiberty, WildFly, JBoss Application Server

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.eclipse.krazo</groupId>
  <artifactId>krazo-resteasy</artifactId>
  <version>3.0.1</version>
</dependency>
```

### Other

Eclipse Krazo can also run in a Jakarta Servlet container, such as Apache Tomcat or Eclipse Jetty, but that will require a bit of configuration to assemble the correct Jakarta EE Dependencies.
