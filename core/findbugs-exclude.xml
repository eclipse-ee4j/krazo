        Sure, these inner classes might be more efficient if they

        Arrays are passed in and out of internal APIs all over the place.
        Mostly this is just fine.  Finding the few places where this might
        be a real issue is a problem for another day.

        We do I/O using the default encoding everywhere, usually
